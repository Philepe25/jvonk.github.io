Consider the set of all reduced fractions between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominators less than or equal to N.

Here is the set when N = 5:

```none
0/1 1/5 1/4 1/3 2/5 1/2 3/5 2/3 3/4 4/5 1/1
```

Write a program that, given an integer N between 1 and 160 inclusive, prints the fractions in order of increasing magnitude.

### PROGRAM NAME: frac1

### INPUT FORMAT

One line with a single integer N.

### SAMPLE INPUT (file frac1.in)

```none
5
```

### OUTPUT FORMAT

One fraction per line, sorted in order of magnitude.

### SAMPLE OUTPUT (file frac1.out)

```none
0/1
1/5
1/4
1/3
2/5
1/2
3/5
2/3
3/4
4/5
1/1
```
